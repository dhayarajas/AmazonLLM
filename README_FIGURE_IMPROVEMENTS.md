## 📊 File Size Impact

**Note:** High-quality figures are larger - this is NORMAL and REQUIRED.

| Metric | Before | After | Note |
|--------|--------|-------|------|
| File Size | 200-400 KB | 800-1600 KB | 3-5x larger (expected) |
| Resolution | 300 DPI | 600 DPI | 2x better |
| Disk Space | ~2-3 MB total | ~10-15 MB total | Still very manageable |

**Don't compress these files** - you'll lose the quality improvements!

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After generating figures, verify:

- [ ] Open any PNG file
- [ ] Right-click → Properties/Get Info
- [ ] Check dimensions (should be ~2x larger)
- [ ] Check file size (should be 3-5x larger)
- [ ] Open at 100% zoom - text should be crisp
- [ ] Try printing - should look professional
- [ ] Axis labels clearly readable
- [ ] No pixelation or blurriness

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Script crashes"
**Solution:** Use the notebook method instead (Solution 1 or 2)

### Issue 2: "Figures look the same"
**Solution:** Make sure you ran the updated cells, not the old ones

### Issue 3: "Can't find the files"
**Solution:** Check both `media/` and `images/` folders

### Issue 4: "Notebook is slow"
**Solution:** Normal! High-res figures take longer to render (5-10 sec each)

### Issue 5: "File sizes are huge"
**Solution:** This is correct! High-quality = larger files
